# AccessPlusPlus
A hackathon project originally intended to parse accessplus and create a schedule that can be exported to Google Calendar.

This project adds four features to Access Plus for Iowa State:

• Adds a meal counter to the dining page

• Adds integration with Rate My Professor to the sechdule page

• Allows for the exporting of a schedule to .ics from the schedule page

• Displays existing schedule on registration page, updating in real time.
